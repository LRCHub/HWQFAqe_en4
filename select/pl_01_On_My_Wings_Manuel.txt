Don't ask me why
I want you babe 'cause you
Make life so special
And this is what I like more
Don't say you don't wanna love
me
Don't back out and leave me,
babe
I just wanna carry on and burn
you out
Dreamin' forever
I just wanna leave and take you
on my wings
Flying away together
I'd love this beautiful time
Come for this crazy cool night
I just wanna leave and take you
on my wings
Flying away together
You'd like my beautiful game
Come to me babe this night
(Come to me take you on my
wings)
Fill me with love
I need your hot soul, babe
You light my fire
Another night I want you
