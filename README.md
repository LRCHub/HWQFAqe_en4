[00:26.78] Don't ask me why
[00:52.83] I want you babe 'cause you
[00:57.22] Make life so special
[00:59.84] And this is what I like more
[01:13.84] 
[01:03.70] Don't say you don't wanna love me
[01:06.98] Don't back out and leave me, babe
[01:09.77] I just wanna carry on and burn you out
[01:13.22] Dreamin' forever
[01:21.22] 
[01:16.23] I just wanna leave and take you on my wings
[01:19.42] Flying away together
[01:22.71] I'd love this beautiful time
[01:25.69] Come for this crazy cool night
[01:40.69] 
[01:28.71] I just wanna leave and take you on my wings
[01:32.13] Flying away together
[01:34.97] You'd like my beautiful game
[01:37.65] Come to me babe this night
[01:41.72] (Come to me take you on my wings)
[01:58.22] 
[01:55.72] Fill me with love
[01:58.48] I need your hot soul, babe
[02:00.59] You light my fire
[02:04.30] Another night I want you
